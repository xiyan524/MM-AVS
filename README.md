# MM-AVS: <u>M</u>ulti-<u>m</u>odal <u>A</u>rticle and <u>V</u>ideo <u>S</u>ummarization
A Full-Scale Dataset for Multi-modal Summarization


MM-AVS is a full-scale multimodal dataset comprehensively gathering documents, summaries, images, captions, videos, audios, transcripts, and titles in English from CNN and Daily Mail. To our best knowledge, this is the first collection that spans all modalities and nearly comprises all types of materials available in this community.


We're sharing them here for developers and researchers to explore, study, and learn from.
